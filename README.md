### How to set up the server

Install the 'Live Server' by 'Ritwick Dey'

Right click on the index.html and select 'Open with live server'

It should open to this 'http://127.0.0.1:5501/src/html/index.html'

### Browser testing

I tested the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox on my laptop on mobile, tablet, and desktop sized screens.

I tested my code on IE and it did not work correctly. I decided to prioritise spending time on other parts of my code as IE is no longer going to be supported in August (I believe). However, if I had more time I would spend more time and fix it.

I was not able to test on Safari as I did not have access to apple products or a way of testing online that I trusted. If you have a recommended testing site and would like me to test my code there I would be happy to do so.

### Accessibility SEO Performance

I tested my code using the WAVE extension and the Lighthouse tab.

### File and folder layout

The most important files are:

index.html

homepage.scss

homepage.js

### Effects and animations

On the desktop hover on the image and it will increase in size.

On the desktop hover on the button and there is a colour change.

The cursor is now a circle that increases in size when you click on something.
